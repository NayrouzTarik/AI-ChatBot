      "1.1.\n",
      "Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  \n",
      "This explanatory memorandum accompanies the proposal for a Regulation laying down \n",
      "harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act). Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "(AI) is a fast evolving family of technologies that can bring a wide array of economic and \n",
      "societal benefits across the entire s pectrum of industries and social activities.\n",
      "By improving \n",
      "prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising service delivery, \n",
      "the use of artificial intelligence can support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes \n",
      "and pro vide key competitive advantages to companies and the European economy. Such \n",
      "action is especially needed in high -impact sectors, including climate change, environment and \n",
      "health, the public sector, finance, mobility, home affairs and agriculture.\n",
      "However, t he same \n",
      "elements and techniques that power the socio -economic benefits of AI can also bring about \n",
      "new risks or negative consequences for individuals or the society. In light of the speed of \n",
      "technological change and possible challenges, the EU is committed to strive for a balanced \n",
      "approach.\n",
      "It is in the Union interest to preserve the EU’s technological leadership and to \n",
      "ensure that Europeans can benefit from new technologies developed and functioning \n",
      "according to Union values, fundamental rights and principl es.\n",
      "This proposal delivers on the political commitment by President von der Leyen, who \n",
      "announced in her political guidelines for the 2019 -2024 Commission “A Union that strives for \n",
      "more”1, that the Commission would put forward legislation for a coordinated European \n",
      "approach on the human and ethical implications of AI. Following on that announcement, on \n",
      "19 February 2020 the Commission published the White Paper on AI - A European approach \n",
      "to excellence and trust2.\n",
      "The White Paper sets out policy options on how  to achieve the twin \n",
      "objective of promoting the uptake of AI and of addressing the risks associated with certain \n",
      "uses of such technology. This proposal aims to implement the second objective for the \n",
      "development of an ecosystem of trust by proposing a legal  framework for trustworthy AI.\n",
      "The \n",
      "proposal is based on EU values and fundamental rights and aims to give people and other \n",
      "users the confidence to embrace AI -based solutions, while encouraging businesses to develop \n",
      "them. AI should be a tool for people and be a force for good in society with the ultimate aim \n",
      "of increasing human well -being.\n",
      "Rules for AI available in the Union market or otherwise \n",
      "affecting people in the Union should therefore be human centric, so that people can trust that \n",
      "the technology is us ed in a way that is safe and compliant with the law, including the respect \n",
      "of fundamental rights.\n",
      "Following the publication of the White Paper, the Commission \n",
      "launched a broad stakeholder consultation,  which was met with a great interest by a large \n",
      "number of stakeholders who were largely supportive of regulatory intervention to address the \n",
      "challenges and concerns raised by the increasing use of AI.\n",
      "The proposal also responds to explicit requests from the European Parliament (EP) and the \n",
      "European  Council, w hich have repeatedly expressed calls for legislative action to ensure a \n",
      "well-functioning internal market for artificial intelligence systems (‘AI systems’) where both \n",
      "benefits and risks of AI are adequately addressed at Union level.\n",
      "It supports the objecti ve of \n",

      "for the new opportunities and challenges raised by AI.\n",
      "The European Council has also called \n",

      "final.\n",
      "EN 3  EN proposal takes into account the aforementioned resolution of the European Parliament in full \n",
      "respect of proportionality, subsidiarity and better law making principles.\n",
      "Against this political context, the Commission puts forward the proposed regulatory \n",
      "framework on Artificial Intelligence with the following specific objectives : \n",
      " ensure that AI systems placed on the Union market and used are safe and respect \n",
      "existing law on fundamental rights and Union values;  \n",
      " ensure legal certainty to facilitate investmen t and innovation in AI;  \n",
      " enhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamental \n",
      "rights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems;  \n",
      " facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI \n",
      "applications and prevent market fragmentation.\n",
      "To achieve those objectives, this proposal presents a balanced and proportionate horizontal \n",
      "regulatory approach to AI that is limited to the minimum necessary requirements to address \n",
      "the risks and problems linked to AI, withou t unduly constraining or hindering technological \n",
      "development or otherwise disproportionately increasing the cost of placing AI solutions on \n",
      "the market. The proposal sets a robust and flexible legal framework.\n",
      "On the one hand, it is \n",
      "comprehensive and future -proof in its fundamental regulatory choices, including the \n",
      "principle -based requirements that AI systems should comply with.\n",
      "On the other hand, it puts \n",
      "in place a proportionate regulatory system centred on a well -defined risk -based regulatory \n",
      "approach that  does not create unnecessary restrictions to trade, whereby legal intervention is \n",
      "tailored to those concrete situations where there is a justified cause for concern or where such \n",
      "concern can reasonably be anticipated in the near future.\n",
      "At the same time, t he legal \n",
      "framework includes flexible mechanisms that enable it to be dynamically adapted as the \n",
      "technology evolves and new concerning situations emerge. The proposal sets harmonised rules for the development, placement on the market and use of \n",
      "AI systems i n the Union following a proportionate risk -based approach. It proposes a single \n",
      "future -proof definition of AI.\n",
      "Certain particularly harmful AI practices are prohibited as \n",
      "contravening Union values, while specific restrictions and safeguards are proposed in  relation \n",
      "to certain uses of remote biometric identification systems for the purpose of law enforcement. The proposal lays down a solid risk methodology to define “high -risk” AI systems that pose \n",
      "significant risks to the health and safety or fundamental ri ghts of persons.\n",
      "Those AI systems \n",
      "will have to comply with a set of horizontal mandatory requirements for trustworthy AI and \n",
      "follow conformity assessment procedures before those systems can be placed on the Union \n",
      "market. Predictable, proportionate and clea r obligations are also placed on providers and users \n",
      "of those systems to ensure safety and respect of existing legislation protecting fundamental \n",
      "rights throughout the whole AI systems’ lifecycle.\n",
      "For some specific AI systems, only \n",
      "minimum transparency obl igations are proposed, in particular when chatbots or ‘deep fakes’ \n",
      "are used. The proposed rules will be enforced through a governance system at Member States level, \n",
      "building on already existing structures, and a cooperation mechanism at Union level with the \n",
      "establishment of a European Artificial Intelligence Board .\n",
      "Additional measu res are also \n",
      "proposed to support innovation, in particular through AI regulatory sandboxes and other \n",
      "measures to reduce the regulatory burden and to support Small and Medium -Sized Enterprises \n",
      "(‘SMEs’) and start -ups. EN 4  EN 1.2.\n",
      "Consistency with existing policy pr ovisions in the policy area  \n",
      "The horizontal nature of the proposal requires full consistency with existing Union legislation \n",
      "applicable to sectors where high -risk AI systems are already used or likely to be used in the \n",
      "near future. Consistency is also ensu red with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the existing \n",
      "secondary Union legislation on data protection, consumer protection, non -discrimination and \n",
      "gender equality.\n",
      "The proposal is without prejudice and complements the General Data \n",
      "Protection Regula tion (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the Law Enforcement Directive \n",
      "(Directive (EU) 2016/680) with a set of harmonised rules applicable to the design, \n",
      "development and use of certain high -risk AI systems and restrictions on certain uses of remote \n",
      "biometric id entification systems.\n",
      "Furthermore, the proposal complements existing Union law \n",
      "on non -discrimination with specific requirements that aim to minimise the risk of algorithmic \n",
      "discrimination, in particular in relation to the design and the quality of data set s used for the \n",
      "development of AI systems complemented with obligations for testing, risk management, \n",
      "documentation and human oversight throughout the AI systems’ lifecycle. The proposal is \n",
      "without prejudice to the application of Union competition law.\n",
      "As regards high-risk AI systems which are safety components of products, this proposal will \n",
      "be integrated into the existing sectoral safety legislation to ensure consistency, avoid \n",
      "duplications and minimise additional burdens. In particular, as regards  high-risk AI systems \n",
      "related to products covered by the New Legislative Framework (NLF) legislation (e.g.\n",
      "machinery, medical devices, toys), the requirements for AI systems set out in this proposal \n",
      "will be checked as part of the existing conformity assessment pro cedures under the relevant \n",
      "NLF legislation.\n",
      "With regard to the interplay of requirements, while the safety risks specific \n",
      "to AI systems are meant to be covered by the requirements of this proposal, NLF legislation \n",
      "aims at ensuring the overall safety of the  final product and therefore may contain specific \n",
      "requirements regarding the safe integration of an AI system into the final product. The \n",
      "proposal for a Machinery Regulation, which is adopted on the same day as this proposal fully \n",
      "reflects this approach.\n",
      "As regards high-risk AI systems related to products  covered by relevant \n",
      "Old Approach legislation (e.g. aviation, cars), this proposal would not directly apply. However, the ex -ante essential requirements for high -risk AI systems set out in this proposal \n",

      "ensure the establishment and f unctioning of the internal market. This proposal constitutes a core part of the EU digital single market strategy.\n",
      "The primary \n",
      "objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market by setting \n",
      "harmonised rules in particular on the development, placing on the Union market and the use \n",
      "of products and services making use of AI technologies or provided as stand -alone AI \n",
      "systems. Some Member States are already considering national rules to ensure that AI is safe \n",
      "and is developed a nd used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations.\n",
      "This will likely \n",
      "lead to two main problems: i) a fragmentation of the internal market on essential elements \n",
      "regarding in particular the requirements for the AI products and services , their marketin g, \n",
      "their use, the liability  and the supervision  by public authorities , and ii) the substantial \n",
      "diminishment of legal certainty for both providers and users of AI systems on how existing \n",
      "and new rules will apply to those systems in the Union.\n",
      "Given the wide  circulation of products \n",
      "and services across borders, these two problems can be best solved through EU harmonizing \n",
      "legislation. Indeed, the proposal defines common mandatory requirements applicable to the design and \n",
      "development of certain AI systems befor e they are placed on the market that will be further \n",
      "operationalised through harmonised technical standards.\n",
      "The proposal also addresses the \n",
      "situation after AI systems have been placed on the market by harmonising the way in which \n",
      "ex-post controls are cond ucted.\n",
      "In addition, considering that this proposal contains certain specific rules  on the protection of \n",

      "systems for ‘real -time’ remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the \n",

      "Subsidiarity  (for non-exclusive  competence)   \n",
      "The nature of AI, which often relies on large and varied datasets and which may be embedded \n",
      "in any product or service circulating freely within the internal market, entails that the \n",
      "objectives of this proposal cannot be effectively achieved by Member States alone.\n",
      "Furthermore, a n emerging patchwork of potentially divergent national rules will hamper the \n",
      "seamless circulation of products and services related to  AI systems across the EU and will be \n",
      "ineffective in ensuring the safety and protection of fundamental rights and Union values \n",
      "across the different Member States. National approaches in addressing the problems will only \n",
      "create additional legal uncertainty  and barriers, and will slo w market uptake of AI.\n",

      "fragmentation of the Single Market into potentially contradictory national frameworks \n",
      "preventing the free circulation of goods and services emb edding AI. A solid European \n",
      "regulatory framework for trustworthy AI will also ensure a level playing field and protect all \n",
      "people, while strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and industrial basis in AI.\n",
      "Only \n",
      "common action at Union level can also protect t he Union’s digital sovereignty and leverage \n",
      "its tools and regulatory powers to shape global rules and standards. EN 7  EN 2.3. Proportionality  \n",
      "The proposal builds on existing legal frameworks and is proportionate and necessary to \n",
      "achieve its objectives, since it f ollows a risk -based approach and imposes regulatory burdens \n",
      "only when an AI system is likely to pose high risks to fundamental rights and safety.\n",
      "For \n",
      "other, non -high-risk AI systems, only very limited transparency obligations are imposed, for \n",
      "example in te rms of the provision of information to flag the use of an AI system when \n",
      "interacting with humans.\n",
      "For high -risk AI systems, the requirements of high quality data, \n",
      "documentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy and robustness, are \n",
      "strictly necessary to mitigate the risks to fundamental rights and safety posed by AI and that \n",
      "are not covered by other existing legal frameworks. Harmonised standards and supporting \n",
      "guidance and compliance tools will assist providers and users in complying  with the \n",
      "requirements laid down by the proposal  and minimise their costs.\n",
      "The costs incurred by \n",
      "operators are proportionate to the objectives achieved and the economic and reputational \n",
      "benefits that operators can expect from this proposal. 2.4. Choice  of the instrument  \n",
      "The choice of a regulation as a legal instrument is justified by the need for a uniform \n",
      "application of the new rules, such as definition of AI, the prohibition of certain harmful AI -\n",
      "enabled practices and the classification of certain AI syst ems.\n",
      "The direct applicability of a \n",
      "Regulation, in accordance with Article 288 TFEU, will reduce legal fragmentation and \n",
      "facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI systems.\n",
      "It \n",
      "will do so, in particular, by introducing a harmonised set of core requirements with regard to \n",
      "AI systems classified as high -risk and obligations for providers and users of those systems, \n",
      "improving the protection of fundamental rights and providing legal certainty for operators and \n",
      "consumers alike .\n",
      "At the same time, the provisions of the regulation are not overly prescriptive and leave room \n",
      "for different levels of Member State action for elements that do not undermine the objectives \n",
      "of the initiative, in particular the internal organisation of the market surveillance system and \n",
      "the uptake of measures to foster innovation. 3. RESULTS  OF EX-POST  EVALUATIONS,  STAKEHOLDER  \n",
      "CONSULTATIONS  AND  IMPACT  ASSESSMENTS  \n",
      "3.1.\n",
      "Stakeholder  consultation  \n",
      "This proposal is the result of extensive consultation with all major stakeholders, in which the \n",
      "general principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the \n",
      "Commission were applied. An online public consultation  was launched on 1 9 February 2020 along with the publication \n",
      "of the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence and ran until 14 June 2020. The objective of that \n",
      "consultation was to collect views and opinions on the White Paper.\n",
      "It targeted all interested \n",
      "stakeholders from the p ublic and private sectors, including governments, local authorities, \n",
      "commercial and non -commercial organisations, social partners, experts, academics and \n",
      "citizens. After analysing all the responses received, the Commission published a summary \n",
      "outcome and t he individual responses on its website22.\n",
      "In total, 1215 contributions were received, of which 352 were from companies or business \n",
      "organisations/associations, 406 from individuals (92%individuals from EU ), 152 on behalf of \n",
      "                                                 \n",

      "Civil society’s voices were \n",
      "represented by 160 respondents (among which 9 consumers’ organisations, 129 non -\n",
      "governmental organisations and 22 trade unions), 72 respondents contributed as ‘others’. Of \n",
      "the 352 business and indu stry representatives, 222 were companies and business \n",
      "representatives, 41.5% of which were micro, small and medium -sized enterprises. The rest \n",
      "were business associations. Overall, 84% of business and industry replies came from the EU -\n",
      "27.\n",
      "Depending on the q uestion, between 81 and 598 of the respondents used the free text \n",
      "option to insert comments. Over 450 position papers were submitted through the EU Survey \n",
      "website, either in addition to questionnaire answers (over 400) or as stand -alone contributions \n",
      "(over  50). Overall, there is a general agreement amongst stakeholders on a need for action. A large \n",
      "majority of stakeholders agree that legislative gaps exist or that new legislation is needed.\n",
      "However, several stakeholders warn the Commission to avoid duplicat ion, conflicting \n",
      "obligations and overregulation. There were many comments underlining the importance of a \n",
      "technology neutral and proportionate regulatory framework. Stakeholders mostly requested a narrow, clear and precise definition for AI.\n",
      "Stakeholders a lso \n",
      "highlighted that besides the clarification of the term of AI, it is important to define ‘risk’, \n",
      "‘high -risk’, ‘low -risk’, ‘remote biometric identification’ and ‘harm’. Most of the respondents are explicitly in favour of the risk -based approach. Using a risk-based \n",
      "framework was considered a better option than blanket regulation of all AI systems. The types \n",
      "of risks and threats should be based on a sector -by-sector and case -by-case approach.\n",
      "Risks \n",
      "also should be calculated taking into account the impact on  rights and safety. Regulatory sandboxes could be very useful for the promotion of AI  and are welcomed by \n",
      "certain stakeholders, especially the Business Associations. Among those who formulated their opinion on the enforcement models, more than 50%, \n",
      "especi ally from the business associations, were in favour of a combination of an ex -ante risk \n",
      "self-assessment and an ex -post enforcement for high -risk AI systems. 3.2.\n",
      "Collection  and use of expertise  \n",
      "The proposal builds on two years of analysis and close involve ment of stakeholders, including \n",
      "academics, businesses, social partners, non -governmental organisations, Member States and \n",
      "citizens.\n",
      "The preparatory work started in 2018 with the setting up of a High -Level Expert \n",
      "Group on AI (HLEG) which had an inclusive an d broad composition of 52 well -known \n",
      "experts tasked to advise the Commission on the implementation of the Commission’s Strategy \n",
      "on Artificial Intelligence. In April 2019, the Commission supported23 the key requirements set \n",
      "out in the HLEG ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI24, which had been revised to take into \n",
      "account more than 500 submissions from stakeholders.\n",
      "The key requirements reflect a \n",
      "widespread and common approach, as evidenced by a plethora of ethical codes and principles \n",
      "developed by many privat e and public organisations in Europe and beyond, that AI \n",
      "development and use should be guided by certain essential value -oriented principles. The \n",

      "An external study  was also procured to feed into the impact assessment. 3.3. Impact  assessment  \n",
      "In line with its “Better Regulation” policy, the Commission conducted an impact assessment \n",
      "for this proposal examined by the Commission's Regulatory Scrutiny Board. A meeting with \n",
      "the Regulatory Scrutiny Board was held on 16 December 2020, which was follow ed by a \n",
      "negative opinion.\n",
      "After substantial revision of the impact assessment to address the comments \n",
      "and a resubmission of the impact assessment, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive \n",
      "opinion on 21 March 2021. The opinions of the Regulatory Scru tiny Board, the \n",
      "recommendations and an explanation of how they have been taken into account are presented \n",
      "in Annex 1 of the impact assessment.\n",
      "The Commission examined different policy options to achieve the general objective of the \n",
      "proposal, which is to ensure the proper functioning of the single market  by creating the \n",
      "conditions for the development and use of trustworthy AI in the Union.\n",
      "Four policy options of different degrees of regulatory intervention were assessed:  \n",
      " Option 1 : EU legislative instrument setting up a voluntary labelling scheme;  \n",
      " Option 2 : a sectoral, “ad -hoc” approach;  \n",
      " Option 3 : Horizontal EU legislative instrument following a proportionate risk -\n",

      " Option 3+ : Horizontal EU legislative instrument following a proportionate risk -\n",
      "based approach + codes of conduct for non -high-risk AI systems;  \n",
      " Option 4 : Horizontal EU legislative instrument establishing mandatory \n",
      "requirements for all AI systems, irrespective of the risk they pose.\n",
      "According to the Commission's established methodology, each policy option was evaluated \n",
      "against economic and societal impacts, with a particular focus on impacts on fundamental \n",
      "rights. The preferred option is option 3+, a regulatory framework for high -risk AI systems \n",
      "only, with the possibility for all providers of non -high-risk AI systems to follow a code of \n",
      "conduct.\n",
      "The requirements will concern data, documentation and traceability, provision of \n",

      "EN 10  EN The preferred option was considered suitable to address in the most effective way the \n",
      "objectives of this proposal. By requiring a restricted yet effective set of actions from AI \n",
      "developers and users, the preferred option limits the risks of violation of fundamental rights \n",
      "and safety of people and foster effective supervision and enforcement, by targeting the \n",

      "Regulatory  fitness  and simplification  \n",
      "This proposal lays down obligation that will apply to providers and users of high -risk AI \n",

      "create lega l certainty and ensure that no obstacle to the cross -border provision of AI -related \n",
      "services and products emerge. For companies using AI, it will promote trust among their \n",
      "customers.\n",
      "For national public administrations, it will promote public trust in the use of AI \n",
      "and strengthen enforcement mechanisms (by introducing a European coordination \n",
      "mechanism, providing for appropriate capacities, and facilitating audits of the AI systems \n",
      "with new requirements for documentation, traceability and transparency).\n",
      "More over, the \n",
      "framework will envisage specific measures supporting innovation, including regulatory \n",
      "sandboxes and specific measures supporting small -scale users and providers of high -risk AI \n",
      "systems to comply with the new rules . The proposal also specifically aims at strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and industrial \n",
      "basis in AI. Full consistency is ensured with existing sectoral Union legislation applicable to EN 11  EN AI systems (e.g.\n",
      "on products and services) that will bring further clarity and simplify the \n",
      "enforc ement of the new rules. 3.5. Fundamental  rights  \n",
      "The use of AI with its specific characteristics (e.g. opacity, complexity, dependency on data, \n",
      "autonomous behaviour) can adversely affect a number of fundamental rights enshrined in the \n",

      "This proposal seeks to ensure a high level \n",
      "of protection for those fundamental rights and aims to address various sources of risks \n",
      "through a clearly defined risk -based approach.\n",
      "With a set of requirements for trustworthy AI \n",
      "and proportionate obligations on all value chain participants, the proposal will enhance and \n",
      "promote the protection of the rights  protected by the Charter: the right  to human dignity \n",
      "(Article 1), respect for private life and protection of personal data (Articl es 7 and 8), non -\n",
      "discrimination (Article 21) and equality between women and men (Article 23).\n",
      "It aims to \n",
      "prevent a chilling effect on the rights to freedom of expression (Article 11) and freedom of \n",
      "assembly (Article 12), to ensure protection of the right t o an effective remedy and to a fair \n",
      "trial, the rights of defence and the presumption of innocence (Articles 47 and 48), as well as \n",
      "the general principle of good administration.\n",
      "Furthermore, as applicable in certain domains, \n",
      "the proposal will positively aff ect the rights of a number of special groups, such as the \n",
      "workers’ rights to fair and just working conditions (Article 31), a high level of consumer \n",
      "protection (Article 28), the rights of the child (Article 24) and the integration of persons with \n",
      "disabilit ies (Article 26).\n",
      "The right to a high level of environmental protection and the \n",
      "improvement of the quality of the environment (Article 37) is also relevant, including in \n",
      "relation to the health and safety of people.\n",
      "The obligations for ex ante testing, risk  \n",
      "management and human oversight will also facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights \n",
      "by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI -assisted decisions in critical areas such as \n",
      "education and training, employment, important services, law enforceme nt and the  judiciary.\n",
      "In \n",
      "case infringements of fundamental rights still happen, effective redress for affected persons \n",
      "will be made possible by ensuring transparency and traceability of the AI systems coupled \n",
      "with strong ex post controls.\n",
      "This proposal imp oses some restrictions on the freedom to conduct business (Article 16) and \n",
      "the freedom of art and science (Article 13) to ensure compliance with overriding reasons of \n",
      "public interest such as health, safety, consumer protection and the protection of other \n",
      "fundamental rights  (‘responsible innovation’) when high -risk AI technology is developed and \n",
      "used.\n",
      "Those restrictions are proportionate and limited to the minimum necessary to prevent \n",
      "and mitigate serious safety risks and likely infringements of fundamental rights.\n",
      "The increased transparency obligations will also not disproportionately affect the right to \n",
      "protection of intellectual property (Article 17(2)), since they will be limited only to the \n",
      "minimum necessary information for individuals to exercise their right to an effective remedy \n",
      "and to the necessary transparency towards supervision and enforcement authorities, in line \n",
      "with their mandates.\n",
      "Any disclosure of information will be carried out in compliance with \n",
      "relevant legislation in the field, including Directive 2016/943 on the protection of undisclosed \n",
      "know -how and business information (trade secrets) against their unlawful acquisition, use and \n",
      "disclosure . When public authorities and notified bodies need to be given access to confidential \n",
      "information or source code to examine compliance with substantial obligations, they are \n",
      "placed under binding confidentiality obligations.\n",
      "4. BUDGETARY  IMPLICATIONS  \n",
      "Member States will have to designate supervisory authorities in charge of implementing the \n",
      "legislative requ irements. Their supervisory function could build on existing arrangements, for EN 12  EN example regarding conformity assessment bodies or market surveillance, but would require \n",
      "sufficient technological expertise and human and financial resources.\n",
      "Depending on the p re-\n",
      "existing structure in each Member State, this could amount to 1 to 25 Full Time Equivalents \n",
      "per Member State. A detailed overview of the costs involved is provided in the ‘financial statement’ linked to \n",
      "this proposal. 5. OTHER  ELEMENTS  \n",
      "5.1.\n",
      "Implementati on plans  and monitoring,  evaluation  and reporting  arrangements  \n",
      "Providing for a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism is crucial to ensure that the \n",
      "proposal will be effective in achieving its specific objectives. The Commission will be in \n",
      "charge of mon itoring the effects of the proposal. It will establish a system for registering \n",
      "stand -alone high -risk AI applications in a public EU -wide database.\n",
      "This registration will also \n",
      "enable competent authorities, users and other interested people to verify if the  high-risk AI \n",
      "system complies with the requirements  laid down in the proposal  and to exercise enhanced \n",
      "oversight over those AI systems posing high risks to fundamental rights. To feed this \n",
      "database, AI providers will be obliged to provide meaningful inform ation about their systems \n",
      "and the conformity assessment carried out on those systems .\n",
      "Moreover, AI providers will be obliged to inform national competent authorities about serious \n",
      "incidents or malfunctioning that constitute a breach of fundamental rights obligations as soon \n",
      "as they become aware of them, as well as any recalls or withdrawals of AI systems from the \n",
      "market. National competent authorities will then investigate the incidents/or malfunctioning, \n",
      "collect all the necessary information and regularly  transmit it to the Commission with \n",
      "adequate metadata.\n",
      "The Commission will complement this information on the incidents by a \n",
      "comprehensive analysis of the overall market for AI. The Commission will publish a report evaluating and reviewing the proposed AI  framework \n",
      "five years following the date on which it becomes applicable. 5.2. Detailed  explanation  of the specific  provisions  of the proposal  \n",
      "5.2.1.\n",
      "SCOPE  AND  DEFINITIONS  (TITLE  I) \n",
      "Title I defines the subject matter of the regulation and the scope of application of the new \n",
      "rules that cover the placing on the market, putting into service and use of AI systems . It also \n",
      "sets out the definitions used throughout the instrument. The definition of AI system in the \n",
      "legal framework aims to be as technology neutral and future proof as possible, taking into \n",
      "account the fast technological and market developments related to AI.\n",
      "In order to provide the \n",
      "needed legal certainty, Title I is complemented by Ann ex I, which contains a detailed list of \n",
      "approaches and techniques for the development of AI to be adapted by the Commission in line \n",
      "with new technological developments. Key participants across the AI value chain are also \n",
      "clearly defined such as providers a nd users of AI systems that cover both public and private \n",
      "operators to ensure a level playing field. 5.2.2.\n",
      "PROHIBITED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRACTICES (TITLE II)  \n",
      "Title II  establishes a list of prohibited AI. The regulation follows a risk -based approach,  \n",
      "differentiating between uses of AI that create (i) an unacceptable risk, (ii) a high risk, and (iii) \n",
      "low or minimal risk. The list of prohibited practices in Title II comprises all those AI systems \n",
      "whose use is considered unacceptable as contravening Unio n values, for instance by violating \n",
      "fundamental rights.\n",
      "The prohibitions covers practices that have a significant potential to \n",
      "manipulate persons  through subliminal techniques beyond their consciousness or exploit EN 13  EN vulnerabilities of specific vulnerable gro ups such as children or persons with disabilities in \n",
      "order to materially distort their behaviour in a manner that is likely to cause them or another \n",
      "person psychological or physical harm.\n",
      "Other manipulative or exploitative practices affecting \n",
      "adults that m ight be facilitated by AI systems could be covered by the existing data \n",
      "protection, consumer protection and digital service legislation that guarantee that natural \n",
      "persons are properly informed and have free choice not to be subject to profiling or other \n",
      "practices that might affect their behaviour. The proposal also prohibits AI -based social \n",
      "scoring for general purposes done by public authorities.\n",
      "Finally, the use of ‘real time’ remote \n",
      "biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law \n",
      "enforcement is also prohibited unless certain limited exceptions apply. 5.2.3. HIGH -RISK AI SYSTEMS (TITLE III)  \n",
      "Title III contains specific rules for AI systems that create a high risk to the health and safety \n",
      "or fundamental rights of natural persons.\n",
      "In line with a risk -based approach, those high -risk \n",
      "AI systems are permitted on the European market subject to compliance with certain \n",
      "mandatory requirements and an ex -ante conformity assessment. The classification of an AI \n",

      "and use of artificial intelligence in conformity with Union values.\n",
      "This Regulation \n",
      "pursues a number of overriding reasons of public interest, such as a high level of \n",
      "protection of health, safety and fundamental rights, and it ensures the free movement \n",
      "of AI -based goods and services cross -border, thus preventing Member States from \n",
      "imposing restrictions on th e development, marketing and use of AI systems, unless \n",
      "explicitly authorised by this Regulation.\n",
      "(2) Artificial intelligence systems (AI systems) can be easily deployed in multiple sectors \n",
      "of the economy and society, including cross border, and circulate throughout the \n",
      "Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to \n",
      "ensure that artificial intelligence is safe and is developed and used in compliance with \n",
      "fundamental rights obligations.\n",
      "Differing national rules may lead t o fragmentation of \n",
      "the internal market and decrease legal certainty for operators that develop or use AI \n",
      "systems.\n",
      "A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should \n",
      "therefore be ensured, while divergences hampering the free circulation o f AI systems \n",
      "and related products and services within the internal market should be prevented, by \n",

      "this Regulation, in as far as those specific rules are concerned, on Articl e 16 of the \n",
      "TFEU. In light of  those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is \n",
      "appropriate  to consult the European Data Protection Board.\n",
      "(3) Artificial intelligence is a fast evolving family of technologies that can contribute to a \n",
      "wide arr ay of economic and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries \n",
      "and social activities.\n",
      "By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource \n",
      "allocation, and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and \n",
      "organisations, th e use of artificial intelligence can provide key competitive advantages \n",
      "to companies and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for \n",

      "and use, artificial intelligence may genera te risks and cause harm to public interests \n",
      "and rights that are protected by Union law. Such harm might be material or \n",
      "immaterial.\n",
      "(5) A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence is \n",
      "therefore needed to foster the develop ment, use and uptake of artificial intelligence in \n",
      "the internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public \n",
      "interests, such as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, as \n",
      "recognised and protected by Union law.\n",
      "To achieve that objective, rules regulating the \n",
      "placing on the market and putting into service of certain AI systems should be laid \n",
      "down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those \n",
      "systems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services.\n",
      "By \n",
      "laying down those rules, this Regulation supports the objective of the Union of being a \n",
      "global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical artificial \n",
      "intelligence, as stated by the European Counci l33, and it ensures the protection of \n",
      "ethical principles, as specifically requested by the European Parliament34. (6) The notion of AI system should be clearly defined to ensure legal certainty, while \n",
      "providing the flexibility to accommodate future technolog ical developments.\n",

      "and Article 3(13) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the \n",
      "Council37.\n",
      "(8) The notion of remote biometric identification system as used in this Regulation should \n",
      "be defined functionally, as  an AI system  intended for the identification of natural \n",
      "persons at a distance through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the \n",
      "biometric data contained in a reference database, and without prior knowledge whether \n",
      "the targeted person will be present and can  be identified, irrespectively of the \n",
      "particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used.\n",
      "Considering their \n",
      "different characteristics and manners in which they are used, as well as the different \n",
      "risks involved, a distinction should be made be tween ‘real -time’ and ‘post’ remote \n",
      "biometric identification systems. In the case of ‘real -time’ systems, the capturing of \n",
      "the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all instantaneously, \n",
      "near-instantaneously or in any event without a s ignificant delay.\n",
      "In this regard, there \n",
      "should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real -time’ \n",
      "use of the AI systems in question by providing for minor delays. ‘Real -time’ systems \n",
      "involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near -‘live’ mate rial, such as video footage, generated by a \n",
      "camera or other device with similar functionality.\n",
      "In the case of ‘post’ systems, in \n",
      "contrast, the biometric data have already been captured and the comparison and \n",
      "identification occur only after a significant de lay. This involves material, such as \n",
      "pictures or video footage generated by  closed circuit television cameras or private \n",
      "devices, which has been generated before the use of the system in respect of the \n",
      "natural persons concerned.\n",
      "(9) For the purposes of thi s Regulation the notion of publicly accessible space should be \n",
      "understood as referring to any physical place that is accessible to the public, \n",
      "irrespective of whether the place in question is privately or publicly owned.\n",
      "Therefore, \n",
      "the notion does not cove r places that are private in nature and normally not freely \n",
      "accessible for third parties, including law enforcement authorities, unless those parties \n",
      "have been specifically invited or authorised, such as homes, private clubs, offices, \n",

      "That approach should tailor \n",
      "the type and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI \n",

      "disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour. Such AI \n",
      "systems should be therefore prohibited.\n",
      "(18) The use of AI systems for ‘real -time’ remote biometric identification of natural \n",
      "persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is considered \n",
      "particularly intrusive in the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent \n",

      "spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific \n",
      "authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a \n",

      "characterised by a significant de gree of power imbalance and may lead to surveillance, \n",
      "arrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as other adverse impacts on \n",
      "fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter.\n",
      "In particular, if the AI system is not \n",

      "the high -risk AI system performs as intended and safely and it does not become the \n",

      "complex for natural persons, a certain d egree of transparency should be required for \n",
      "high-risk AI systems. Users should be able to interpret the system output and use it \n",

      "For this purpose, appropriate human oversight \n",
      "measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing on the \n",

      "guarantee that the system is sub ject to in -built operational constraints that cannot be \n",
      "overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the \n",
      "natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary \n",
      "competence, training and authority to  carry out that role.\n",
      "(49) High -risk AI systems should perform consistently throughout their lifecycle and meet \n",
      "an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity in accordance with the \n",
      "generally acknowledged state of the art. The level of acc uracy and accuracy metrics \n",
      "should be communicated to the users. (50) The technical robustness is a key requirement for high -risk AI systems. They should \n",
      "be resilient against risks connected to the limitations of the system (e.g.\n",
      "errors, faults, \n",
      "inconsiste ncies, unexpected situations) as well as against malicious actions that may \n",
      "compromise the security of the AI system and result in harmful or otherwise \n",
      "undesirable behaviour. Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety \n",
      "impacts or negatively  affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous \n",
      "decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.\n",
      "(51) Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against \n",
      "attempts to alter their use, behaviour, performance or compromise their security \n",
      "properties by malicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI systems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data \n",
      "sets (e.g. data poisoning) or trained models (e.g .\n",
      "adversarial attacks), or exploit \n",
      "vulnerabilities in the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures should \n",
